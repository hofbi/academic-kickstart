I am a Senior Build Engineer and Tech Lead of the Build & Release Engineering team at [Luminar Technologies](https://www.luminartech.com/) working on a monorepo build system, developer tooling, and the CI/CD pipeline.
Currently, we are migrating our build system to Bazel.

I am passionate about software engineering and the creation of scalable code, which is maintainable over time.
Currently, I am teaching these principles at TUM to undergraduate students by offering the [Software Engineering Lab](teaching/software-lab).

I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at [the Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/) for both Bachelor and Master.
From 2016 to 2018, I was a Software Engineer at the Objective Software GmbH and Luxoft Inc and worked in cooperation with the BMW Group in the area of Automotive and Autonomous Driving.
From 2019 to 2022, I worked at the [Chair of Media Technology](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lmt/home/) at TUM as a Research and Teaching Associate in the research group of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Eckehard Steinbach](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lmt/team/staff/steinbach-eckehard/), where I received my Engineering Doctorate in 2022.
My [research](project/research) at TUM was focused on video processing, compression, and transmission of multi-camera systems for autonomous and teleoperated driving.
In 2022, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [CareX.AI](https://carex.ai) working on the software architecture and quality of our monorepository.
My research at [CareX.AI](https://carex.ai) was focused on camera-based vital signs measurement.
